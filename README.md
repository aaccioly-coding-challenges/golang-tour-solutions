# A Tour of Go Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises in "[A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/)".

## License

The original code excerpts from the Go Tour, included or adapted from the official Go Tour repository, are licensed
under the BSD 3-Clause License by The Go Authors.

My contributions and modifications are, in practice, not substantial enough to warrant separate licensing, but I have
chosen to license this repository under the same BSD 3-Clause License for consistency. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file
for details.

Since intentions matter, let me state upfront that I'm using this as an exercise to refresh my knowledge of the Go
language and to practise source control and versioning with [Jujutsu](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/). I couldn't
care less about how you use my code. Copy it, modify it, feed it to an AI, ignore it, whatever. Just don't do anything
that the original [Go Tour](https://go.dev/tour/) authors and the BSD-3-Clause License don't allow.
